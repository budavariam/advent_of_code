# 2018

Golang on Windows/Ubuntu with Visual Studio Code.

This repository is checked out in my `${golang_project_directory}/src` folder.

The inlined paths of the `input.txt` files expect that you **run** the code from the `2018` directory.

Operation | Command
---- | ----
**Test** current day | `go test advent_of_code/2018/{day}_{part}`
**Run** code for current day | `go run advent_of_code/2018/{day}_{part}`

* `${day}`: number from `01` to `25` (or actual latest). Padded to 2 decimal places.
* `${part}`: `1` or `2` depending on what part do you want to check.
